        <h1>About</h1>
        <p id="about">My hobby is to draw. Many artists have developed the skill and mastered it. Drawing can challenge your brain and your hand to make simple shapes which turn into great drawings. To perfect this skill you might take hours, days, weeks, and maybe even months. Now... you might be thinking, drawing is really hard to master. But what if I told you that drawing, is really easy?! I try to do at least 1-2 drawings every week. This way I can perfect my sketches.</p>

        <h1>Work</h1>
        <p id="work">One of the things you need to start doodling are the right materials. Maybe you want no white space at all while coloring and want to take maximum 15 mins to complete coloring. In that case, you would probably want a thick marker. You should also have things to draw on. Paper is the most commonly used thing, but if you are using markers, it would be a little better to use a canvas. You could also just use a thick sheet of paper (You could also use normal paper with markers that don't bleed through the other page). The second thing is practice. Practice is SOOO important!!! If you ever want to become an artist, you need PRACTICE. My 4th grade ELA teacher always says that practice makes permanent. The final thing is your imaginary. You need to exacute your thoughts and creativity down on the paper. You could also just draw something that happend to you or someone else.</p>

        <p id="fav">Here is my most favorite drawing I made. It's not necessarily the 'Best Drawing'. I also did watch a video for this. I put the video preview down below. I encourage all of you to doodle anything and appreciate it, even if it looks bad!</p>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p id="ins">I started drawing in the first place because of my school. There was an art class in the school I went to. I saw great sketches from different people with my very own eyes. I soon decided that I wanted to learn the talent. From then on I kept practicing and practicing until 4th grade. When I started 4th grade, which was just 2-3 months ago from when I wrote this sentence, I became really good at the skill, but not the best.</p>
